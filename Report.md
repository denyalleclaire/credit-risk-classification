## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

The purpose of this exercise was to determine whether Logistic Regression Model can be accurate in predicting healthy loans versus high risk loans using original and resampled data. 
The process included preparing the data, separating the data, train_test_split, choose ML Model for classification, fit the model with training data, use the model to make predictions and evalaute the predictions. 

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1
          Accuracy: 0.99
          Precision: Class 0: 1.00 Class 1: 0.85
          Recall scores: Class 0: 0.99 Class 1: 0.91



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 
          Accuracy: 0.99
          Precision: Class 0: 1.00 Class 1: 0.84
          Recall scores: Class 0: 0.99 Class 1: 0.99

## Summary

Overall the Logistic Regression model performed very well with a high level of accuracy.
